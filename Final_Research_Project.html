<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>This study questions whether the evolution of a genre can be examined
through the deformation of the works of two influential authors across a
difference of a few decades. Deformation is a process by itself and can
be considered both an interpretation and something to be interpreted
(Samuels and McGann, 1999). This study asks if differences in genre
conventions can be noticed through the computational analysis of two
different authors’ works. This study uses a novella of Sherlock Holmes
stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and “The Mysterious Affair at
Styles” by Agatha Christie. These two stories are then run through the
web-based analysis tool, Voyant.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The literary examination of a piece of work is an in-depth process
that takes time and focus. The method of such literary interpretations
is usually defined by close reading. Close reading refers to the act of
reading a piece of literature to notice details and connections and form
a cohesive theme or idea around these details. The article or idea
discussed this way is usually discovered after reading the literature
multiple times and examining the notes taken. Samuels and McGann (1999)
discuss the process of deforming a piece of literature and using that
new creation to explore the original work. The issue with close reading
is that spending so much time with a work of literature might leave the
reader dulled to certain aspects of the work. The idea behind
deformation is to break apart the intended literature and put it back
together to allow the reader to observe it from a new perspective. This
study seeks to examine if and how a genre evolves across a period of a
few decades and a World War. A genre’s stylings should be evident
regardless of the state of their work, deformed or otherwise. Through
Voyant, this study will analyze if and how a genre changes through the
years and what elements stay the same. Also, the features that remain
the same will be discussed after the results of the study are revealed.
Breaking down a piece of literature should provide enough details and
specific information in order for a viewer to compare its components to
the conventions of a genre. Even though, close reading would likely be a
better fit for a study like this, using Voyant is important to determine
the methodology of using computers to analyse literature (Kirschenbaum,
2010). https://arcg.is/1Gi0nL0</p>

<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<p>The process began by selecting two stories from the same genre from
the Sherlock Holmes’ era and the “Golden era” (Humpherys, 2017). Using
the Gutenberg database, the stories were first, a novella of Sherlock
Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle and “The Mysterious Affair at
Styles” by Agatha Christie. The novella of Sherlock Holmes stories was
written between 1891-1894 while “The Mysterious Affair at Styles” was
written in 1916 and published in 1920. Both stories are of the British
detective fiction genre. The first text was the first Sherlock Holmes’
story written by the author while the second is the last. Voyant is the
primary tool used in this study. It is a web-based analysis and reading
tool for digital texts. Voyant is the "deformation" tool this study will
use to examine the two texts. Both texts were entered into the website,
Voyant and the tool's analysis of the texts was produced. Specific terms
that were irrelevant to this study had to be removed from the data
results of the tool's investigation, such as "gutenberg.org," which is
the site of the stories' online publication. The display of the timeline
of the publishing of each corpus will be done through the tool,
StoryMaps. It provides a clear and evident display of the timeline and
the reason why an evolution of the genre might have happened (Drucker,
2011).</p>

<p>The above images are the trend chart of the Holmes novella and its
word tree chart. For the trend chart, green is “said,” purple is “mr,”
blue is “holmes,” pink is “man,” and cyan is “little.” The word chart is
a visualization that connects the most used word with its various
contexts and accompanying words in order of frequency. The center word
of the chart is “said.” This corpus has a vocabulary index of 0.076, a
readability index of 7.407 and an average word per sentence count of
16.2.</p>
<p><img src="Poirot_Trend.png" /> <img src="Poirot_WrodTree.png" /> The
above trend chart has green for “said,” blue for “yes,” pink for
“Poirot,” purple is “mrs,” and cyan for “inglethorp.” The word chart has
its center or stem word as “Poirot” who is the detective lead of the
Agatha Christie novel. This corpus has a vocabulary index of 0.094, a
readability index of 8.201 and an average word per sentence count of
11.6.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>When looking at the two trend charts, there is no significant
difference in the words in the chart between the two texts. There are
the words “said”, “Mr.”/” Mrs.” and the name of their starring
detective. The word “man” in the trend chart of the Sherlock stories
don’t seem be anything other than a product of his writing style. Its
presence could also be seen as the evidence of the stories focus on male
characters. The other words in each trend chart are context specific to
the plot of the texts that they come from. If we compare the most
important words and similar words in each text, we can attribute a
convention of the genre to each word. “Mr.” and “Mrs.” represent the
wealthy client and the suspects. “Said” represents the narration of the
sidekick or outside observer and the name of the detective represents
the rational detective solving the mystery.</p>
<p>The trend chart graphs, on the other hand, present some interesting
data. “Holmes” follows a wave-like pattern in the Sherlock corpus while
“Poirot” has a mountain-like pattern on the graph. Holmes is
consistently present throughout his stories while Poirot is not as
frequently mentioned at the beginning and ending of the text. The word
“said” is present on both charts and presents an interesting contrast
which could be either an evolution of style or genre. “Said” has a high
frequency of occurrence in the Holmes stories, almost as much as the
word “holmes.” On the other hand, “said” has a much more moderate
presence in the Agatha novel.</p>
<p>Looking at the word tree charts, it becomes clear that these texts
are similar, and any differences are the result of the author’s style as
opposed to any evolution of the genre. There might be a method that
allows Voyant to explore the change in genre across different authors,
but the method used in this study is not it. The word tree of the
Sherlock stories explains why “said” was the most frequency used word in
that corpus but not in the Agatha corpus. The Poirot word tree
beautifully displays how Agatha Christie made use of verbs to replace
“said” in her novel. This is mostly a stylistic difference however and
shows no signs of a difference or evolution in genre. Instead, the
differences show a marked improvement in writing quality and style over
the years.</p>
